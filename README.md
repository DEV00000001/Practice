# ðŸ“š Learning Examples Repository

This repository is used to store **code examples** during my learning process.  
Each branch (`course/...`) represents a **lesson/topic** Iâ€™m working on, containing demo code and small exercises.  

---

## ðŸ—‚ Branch Structure

- **`main`**: Default branch, stable code.
- **`develop`**: Integration branch where all course branches are merged through Pull Requests.
- **`course/...`**: Each branch with the `course/` prefix represents a **specific lesson**, for example:
  - `course/code-splitting`
  - `course/object-date-and-library-date`
  - `course/userEffect-mistake-every-junior-react...`

---

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. When starting a new lesson â†’ create a branch `course/[lesson-name]`.
2. Write example code and commit changes in that branch.
3. When finished â†’ open a **Pull Request** into the `develop` branch.
4. After review/merge into `develop`, it can later be merged into `main` as a stable version.
